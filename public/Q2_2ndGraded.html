                This is Rubidium's Tuesday schedule for the entire school year of 2025-2026. 
                First, we have english and health to start off the day. Then we have double period physics, which is torture before 
                absolute rest. After that we have social science, a chill subject, followed by lunch. Then, we have math, where people experience another 
                form of torture. But it's okay because we have study period right after, which can be maximized to do CS homework or study for CS. Finally, we have double period 
                computer science to end the day. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Personally, this schedule is my favorite because it perfectly combines both hard and easy subjects, giving me a balanced day. The inclusion of two study periods 
                throughout the day provides opportunity to catch up on work, review difficult concepts, or prepare for upcoming classes. 
                Additionally, the double periods for physics and computer science allow for deeper understanding of the material without switching gears every 45 minutes.
